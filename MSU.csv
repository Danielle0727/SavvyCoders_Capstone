The worst offenders are NBC and CNN but all are guilty! Their obvious bias and twisted reporting clearly shows they are managed and directed by extremist liberal elements dedicated to the dismantling of the Constitution of the United States in favor of their Socialist Agenda. Facebook allows the continuous spreading of misinformation and outright lies and worse still actively censors many (Most?) individuals who challenge the lies and disinformation. Everyone is so busy trying to put a political spin on every piece of data and statement that it resembles a TORNADO OUTBREAK!

AFTER PEOPLE STOPPED DYING A GROUP OF DOCTORS WHO WERE ALSO INVESTIGATORS ASKED THIS QUESTION ""WHY DID 600 PEOPLE IN CHINA DIE BUT ONLY 2 PEOPLE IN THE PHILIPPINES DIE? AFTER MANY MONTHS OF INVESTIGATING THEY SAID ""THE PEOPLE IN CHINA DO NOT COOK THEIR FOOD IN ORGANIC VIRGIN COCONUT OIL, BUT THE PEOPLE IN THE PHILIPPINES DO"" SO THEY RAN TESTS OF THE SARS VIRUS AND COCONUT OIL AND FOUND THAT THE ACIDS IN THE OIL WOULD MAKE A HOLE IN THE SHELL OF THE VIRUS AND THEN KILL AND PROTEINS WHICH KILLS THE VIRUS. THIS WHAT I DO TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH PROBLEMS. JUST LIKE I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MY MOTHER DIED OF CANCER.

THE PEOPLE IN THE PHILIPPINES KNOW THIS AND THE OLDER PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE USE IT TO COOK THEIR FOOD IN EVERYDAY. EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT IT KILLS ALL VIRUSES IN THEIR BODY, THEY STILL USE IT. THE PROBLEM IN THEIR COUNTRY IS THE FACT THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE DO NOT USE COCONUT OIL OR NOT ENOUGH TO HELP THEM. I USE IT EVERYDAY IN MY BREAKFAST, THE LAST TIME I GOT THE FLU WAS IN 1993 AND SAME YEAR MY FATHER PAST AWAY. I KNOW THIS OIL WORKS BUT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS A BIG PROBLEM, THEY CAN NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS OIL BECAUSE THE DRUG COMPANIES HAD A LAW PAST PROTECTING THEM AND THE FDA IS DOING EVERYTHING TO DO THAT, PROTECTING THEM.
